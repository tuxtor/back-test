# Nabenik's Java EE basic test

Hi and welcome to this test. As many technical interviews, main test objective is to determine your actual EE skill, being:

- General Java knowledge
- General toolkits, SDK's and other usages
- Java EE general skills

To complete this test, please create a fork of this repository, commit the solutions/answers to YOUR copy and finally do a pull request to the original repo.

The document is structured using [GitHub Markdown Flavor](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code).
